I spend most of my time researching machine-learning techniques for particle physics analyses.
After my undergraduate degree in applied math & theoretical physics at QUB in Belfast, I started a PhD in theoretical particle physics at the University of Sussex in Brighton.
My thesis topic focused on the physics of extra dimensions (Randall-Sundrum models) and composite Higgs models.
From there I went to the University of Plymouth for a postdoc position where we studied ways to search for new light particles in high-intensity laser-electron interactions.
Two years later I was in Ljubljana (Slovenia) on a postdoc position at the Jo≈æef Stefan Institute.
This is when I began working on machine-learning techniques for particle physics analyses, specifically looking at how we can use anomaly detection tools to search for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider experiment.
My next stop from there was Heidelberg (Germany) for my third postdoc position, continuing my research on particle physics & machine-learning.
Having spent enough time moving around I decided to move back to Ireland, taking a job in the private sector as a machine-learning engineer, mostly developing LLM applications.
One year later I started my current job as a lecturer in mathematics on the Magee (Derry) campus at the University of Ulster.
As wll as continuing my research in machine-learning and physics, we're developing a new undergraduate course on [computing and applied mathematics](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/courses/202526/computing-with-applied-mathematics-42302).
