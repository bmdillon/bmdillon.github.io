My research sits at the intersection of particle physics and machine learning.  
A central theme is developing data-driven and interpretable ML methods that can enhance searches for new phenomena in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data, with a particular focus on anomaly detection and unsupervised / weakly supervised approaches.

Alongside ML-for-HEP, I have worked on a range of topics in theoretical physics, including beyond-the-Standard-Model phenomenology with warped extra dimensions and composite Higgs models, and strong-field QED.

- **Theory-informed neural networks**
  - using theoretical knowledge of physics models to optimise neural networks
- **Anomaly detection and model-agnostic searches at the LHC**
  - robust autoencoder-style methods, density/energy-based approaches, and uncertainty-aware pipelines  
- **Interpretable latent representations**
  - learning “physics-aware” structure directly from collision data  
- **Warped extra dimensions / composite Higgs**
  - early-universe dynamics and phase transitions in holographic/RS setups  
- **Strong-field QED and light new particles**
  - laser–electron interactions as precision probes of light scalar/ALP-like states
